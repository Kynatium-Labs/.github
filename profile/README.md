### 🌱 Our Purpose

We don't aim to teach everything. We aim to **spark curiosity**, provide **clear starting points**, and help learners **move forward independently**. Kynatium Labs is designed to be a starting catalyst — not a long-term dependency.

*No courses to sell. No hype to chase. Just honest learning.*

---

### 🧭 Core Principles

- 💡 **Inspiration Before Instruction** — Curiosity comes first; instruction follows naturally.
- 🔍 **Clarity Over Complexity** — Concepts should be understandable before they are advanced.
- 🚀 **Independence-Oriented Learning** — Learners are encouraged to continue beyond the platform.
- 🧱 **Foundational Guidance** — We focus on fundamentals that make future learning easier.

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**
